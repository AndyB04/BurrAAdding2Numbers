Peer Review: Brandon Le - Program is capable of adding two numbers together and printing the sum back into the console. There is also a ply again function that works by pressing any key and also a end function that works by entering no. Data validation is missing, so if there's time it would be nice to add that in and also an option to type a specific phrase like yes to continue playing. Otherwise very good job!
